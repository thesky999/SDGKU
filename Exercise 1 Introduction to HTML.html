    <h1>My First Day at SDGKU FSDI</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2 style="font-size: large;">Introductions</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3 style="font-size: medium;"><i>Dr. Miguel A. Cardenas Jr.</i></h3>
    <p style="font-size: medium;">The first part of the class was dedicated to the Chief Academic Officer (Dr. Miguel A. Cardenas Jr.--if memory serves correct) introducting the program, providing the students with insight into the industry, and getting to know one another.</p>
    <h4 style="font-size: medium;"><i>Dr. Samantha Jimenez</i></h4>
    <p style="font-size: medium;">Our instructor, Dr. Samantha Jimenez, came on shortly thereafter and introduced herself. She set us all up with accounts on Canvas. We began to learn the basic structure of HTML coding by following along with her directions.</p>
    <hr>
    <h5 style="font-size: large;">Homework & Conclusion</h5>
    <hr>
    <p style="font-size: medium;">The professor assigned homework: for us to create our own website based on the content covered thus far. I opened an account with GitHub and started a repository for this program. I then began using Visual Studio Code to draft the .html document that built the webpage for the assignment.</p>
    <p>If the first day is any indication of the program and how the course will unfold, I feel that I will be successful with San Diego Global Knowledge University. I'm looking forward to completing this program and working in the industry.</p>
